# Nighttime-Parenting-Device
This is a senior design project that we completed over 2 semesters - Fall 2021 and Spring 2022.

# Description
This device is a wearable sleeve intended to make the task of caring for a baby during the night more pleasant and less detrimental to the parent's mental health. It has a 
number of functions. It will detect when a baby wakes up in the middle of the night and when a parent comes to comfort the baby, it will output encouraging messages to a screen 
and use the parent's pulse to track agitation and frustration levels. It will use LEDs to model calming breathing and play soothing sounds which can be listened to by plugging
into the headphone jack. When the current caregiver gets too agitated and/or has been at it too long, it will notify the secondary caregiver to take over. It will also track 
and log sessions per caregiver.

We decided to do this project because we are interested in helping young parents navigate parenthood.
